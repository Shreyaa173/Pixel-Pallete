# Pixel-Pallete: A Collaborative Hub for Photographer Teams
Pixel Palette is a web app I built using modern web development to empower photographer teams managing events. It tackles communication hurdles by offering features like chat, task management, and file sharing - all within a central platform. Photographers can organize event details, shot lists, client briefs, and schedules, ensuring everyone stays on the same page. Pixel Palette simplifies workflow by assigning tasks and tracking progress, streamlining the event photography experience for both the team and the client.
